Clorm: An ORM API for Clingo
============================

Introduction
------------

Clorm is a Python library that provides an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) style
interface to the Clingo Answer Set Programming (ASP) solver. It allows *facts*
to be asserted to, and extracted from, the ASP solver in an intuitive and easy
to use way. The goal of this library is to supplement the existing Clingo API to
make it easier to build and maintain Python applications that integrate with
Clingo.

When integrating an ASP program into a larger application a typical requirement
is to model the problem domain as a statically written ASP program, but then to
generate problem instances and process the results dynamically. Clorm makes this
integration cleaner, both in terms of code readability but also by making it
easier to refactor the python code as the ASP program evolves.

- Works with Python 3.8+ and Clingo 5.6+
